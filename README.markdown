# My .vim files

My personal `.vim` files. This repository includes my `~/.vimrc`, `~/.vim` dir, and the plugins I use as git submodules. This repository basically includes my entire vim setup so that I can easily load it onto other systems and have history of it.

## Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/cyphactor/dotvim.git ~/.vim

    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
    ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc

    cd ~/.vim
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

## Upgrade

    cd ~/.vim

    git pull
    git submodule init
    git submodule update

## Color Scheme

My `.vimrc` is setup to use the Solarized Color Scheme which can be found at
[http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized).
My `.vim` directory includes this color scheme as Git submodule just like all
the plugins. The reason I mention this is because I have it configured to use
the non 256 degraded Vim color version. This requires that you are using the
Solarized Color Scheme for your terminal application as well. I for example am
using [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) with the Solarized iTerm 2 color scheme
presets.

## Quick Guide

### Functionality Provided by my vimrc

The `<leader>` key in my `.vimrc` is set to the `,` key.

#### Tab Completion

In insert mode when you start typing and hit tab it will bring up the tab completion interface.

* `<leader>n` - rename the current file
* `<leader>.` - switch between test & implementation code (assumes RSpec, Cucumber, and Ruby)

#### Running Tests

* `<leader>t` - run all tests defined in the current file and store as last test run if in test file, run last stored test run if in implementation file.
* `<leader>T` - run test nearest cursor in current file and store as last test run if in test file, run last stored test run if in implementation file.

#### Generic Fuzzy Matching

* `<leader>f` - fuzzy match all files under the project root directory 
* `<leader>F` - fuzzy match all files under the directory parenting the file currently being editid
* `<leader>b` - fuzzy match all files with buffers currently opened in the vim session

#### Ruby & Rails Fuzzy Matching/Quick Editing

* `<leader>gr` - open topleft split editing Ruby on Rails routes
* `<leader>gR` - show the currently defined Ruby on Rails routes
* `<leader>gv` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `app/views` path
* `<leader>gc` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `app/controllers` path
* `<leader>gm` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `app/models` path
* `<leader>gh` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `app/helpers` path
* `<leader>gl` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `lib` path
* `<leader>gp` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `public` path
* `<leader>gs` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `public/stylesheets/sass` path
* `<leader>gf` - fuzzy match files in the Ruby on Rails `features` path
* `<leader>gg` - open topleft split editing Gemfile

### Plugin Provided Functionality

The following are plugins that my .vim directory includes as Git submodules for
easy upgrading. Below I also provide the commands that I find I use most often
from each of the plugins.

#### vim-surround

Provides functionality to easily manage surroundings parens, quotes, etc.
[http://github.com/tpope/vim-surround](http://github.com/tpope/vim-surround)

* `gc{motion}` - toggle comments
* `gC{motion}` - comment region
* `gcc` - toggle comment current line
* `gCc` - comment current line
* `gc` (visual mode) - toggle comments
* `gC` (visual mode) - comment selected text

#### gist-vim

Provides easy creation of GitHub Gists.
[http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim](http://github.com/mattn/gist-vim)

Provides full blown Git interface inside of Vim. This is very valuble in my
opinion and is worth spending some time learning as it will make your life much
easier.

## Extending and Overriding

Inject your own changes into the existing vim functionality by adding extended
versions of .vimrc and .gvimrc in your home directory. If you add files named
`.vimrc-ext` and `.gvimrc-ext` to your homedirectory, they are sourced at the top
of the vimrc and gvimrc files in this project. Any functions or settings you
add to those files will be available in vim sessions. 

This makes it easy for you to try out this project without losing your
existing vim settings. Simply rename your existing .vimrc to .vimrc-ext and
our .gvimrc to .gvimrc-ext and restart vim. If you don't already have your
settings, we've included `*-ext-example` files in the project. If you want to
try them out, either either move them into your homedirectory with the proper
names or set symbolic links in your home direcory as follows:

ln -s .vim/vimrc-ext-example .vimrc-ext
ln -s .gvim/gvimrc-ext-example .gvimrc-ext
